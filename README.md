 Image Generator Web Application
📌 Overview

The Image Generator Web Application is an AI-powered project developed using Java Spring Boot for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. It allows users to generate images from text prompts by integrating the Stability AI API.

This project was built as part of an internship assignment and helped me gain hands-on experience in integrating AI models with a custom backend, managing API requests, and building a responsive user interface.

✨ Features

Generate high-quality images from text prompts using Stability AI

Advanced image generation settings (image size, style, etc.)

Responsive and interactive ReactJS frontend

Efficient backend API handling using Spring Boot

Real-time image rendering after generation

Practical exposure to integrating different AI models with backend services

 How It Works

The user enters a text prompt in the frontend UI.

The React application sends the prompt to the Spring Boot backend using REST APIs.

The backend processes the request and communicates with the Stability AI API.

The generated image is returned from the AI service.

The frontend displays the generated image in real time.
